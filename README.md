# [sudoku](https://sudoku.jonasgeiler.com)

This is a very simple sudoku game built with Svelte and TailwindCSS.

Have fun! 😉

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The single `npm run dev` command now builds the project in watch mode and serves the `dist` folder so you can visit the app immediately.
